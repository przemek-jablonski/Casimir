// Kotlin inspired scoping functions.
// This is a solution for a problem where there is a need for calling substantial amount of
// methods or property assignments before object will become useful in context of a given task.
//
// `configure` method is an equivalent of `when` Kotlin method, whereas `instantiate`
// is an equivalent of `apply` method.
// More advanced scoping methods are basically impossible to implement in Swift due to
// language immaturity and lack of language and/or compiler features.
// This is one the reasons why invocation of methods is different than in Kotlin
// (eg. configure(object, with) instead of object.configure(with))
// https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/scope-functions.html
